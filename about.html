    <h1>About Shuleni</h1>
    <p>Shuleni was created by Ugandan educators and developers to solve a common challenge: preparing student report cards quickly and accurately. Many schools spend hours calculating grades manually — Shuleni automates the process, saving time and improving accuracy.</p>
    <p>Our mission is to help schools across Uganda digitize their reporting while keeping costs affordable. With a one-time purchase, schools can use Shuleni forever, without worrying about ongoing fees.</p>
