  <h1>Examinations Format for the New Curriculum in Uganda</h1>
  <div class="feature-card sec2">
    <p>The <strong>new curriculum in Uganda</strong>, introduced by the National Curriculum Development Centre (NCDC), replaced the old exam-centered system with a competence-based assessment approach. Instead of focusing only on final examinations, learners are now evaluated through <em>Continuous Assessment</em>, <em>project work</em>, and <em>practical performance</em>. This shift promotes skill development, creativity, and problem-solving — the core goals of the new curriculum.</p>

    <h2>1. Continuous Assessment (CAI)</h2>
    <p>Continuous Assessment now contributes <strong>20% of a learner’s final grade</strong>. Teachers assess students during classroom activities, projects, and practical tasks. This component measures ongoing performance, participation, and acquisition of competencies. Systems like <strong>Shuleni Report Card Management Software</strong> make it easy to record, calculate, and store CAI marks accurately throughout the term.</p>

    <h2>2. End-of-Level Assessment</h2>
    <p>The remaining <strong>80% of the final grade</strong> is determined through national examinations administered by the <strong>Uganda National Examinations Board (UNEB)</strong>. These exams test learners’ ability to apply knowledge and skills in practical contexts rather than simply recall facts. Papers include a mixture of structured questions, short tasks, and problem-solving exercises aligned to real-life situations.</p>

    <h2>3. Emphasis on Competencies</h2>
    <p>Unlike the old format that prioritized memorization, the new examination structure evaluates learners’ competencies such as critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and innovation. For example, questions often require learners to interpret scenarios, analyze data, and suggest creative solutions. This approach reflects the values of the competence-based curriculum.</p>

    <h2>4. Project-Based Assessment</h2>
    <p>Each subject integrates <strong>project work</strong> that encourages learners to investigate and present findings. These projects promote independent research and teamwork. Teachers are required to record project performance as part of Continuous Assessment, a task made faster with Shuleni’s automated report card generator.</p>

    <h2>5. Assessment Records and Reporting</h2>
    <p>Accurate record keeping is essential for the new system. Schools must maintain detailed evidence of learners’ progress throughout the year. <strong>Shuleni</strong> provides a structured digital platform for teachers to enter, update, and generate printable report cards that align perfectly with NCDC’s reporting format — ensuring consistency and compliance.</p>

    <h2>6. Grading and Feedback</h2>
    <p>Performance is reported using descriptive feedback and levels such as <em>Basic, Moderate, and Outstanding</em> for lower secondary, or letter grades aligned to percentage ranges for end-of-term exams. This helps parents and learners understand progress clearly. Shuleni automatically applies the correct grading scale and generates easy-to-read reports for schools.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The new examination format in Uganda represents a modern, holistic approach to learning assessment. By balancing Continuous Assessment and national exams, it ensures that learners are evaluated not just by what they know, but by what they can do. With the <strong>Shuleni Report Card System</strong>, schools can implement these changes smoothly, improve accuracy, and present professional report cards that reflect true learner competence.</p>
