  <h1>Understanding UNEB's "Elements of Construct" in Uganda's New Curriculum</h1>
  <div class="feature-card sec2">
<P>The Uganda National Examinations Board (UNEB) has introduced a new approach to assessment under the new Lower
     Secondary Curriculum. A key feature of this system is the use of "elements of construct," a concept central to how students
      are taught and later examined for their Uganda Certificate of Education (UCE). Understanding
       these constructs is important for students as it guides them in their preparation for UCE examinations.</P>
<h2>What Are the "Elements of Construct"?</h2>
<p> An element of construct is a <strong>grouping of related topics or areas of content</strong> within a specific subject. Instead of testing 
    isolated facts, UNEB now uses these broader themes to structure examination papers. This approach moves beyond rote
     memorization, focusing instead on a student's ability to apply knowledge and demonstrate a deep understanding of core 
     subject competencies.</p>
<P>Uganda's New Curriculum aims to foster critical thinking and practical skills. By organizing the syllabus into these thematic
     constructs, UNEB ensures that assessment is comprehensive and aligned with modern pedagogical principles. Each construct
      outlines specific learning outcomes and competencies that a learner is expected to master.</P>
<h2>How Elements of Construct Shape UCE Exams</h2>
<p>The structure of the O-Level examinations is now directly linked to these elements. UNEB item banks are populated with questions
     designed to test a student's grasp of each specific construct. For example, a Biology exam paper is split into different
      sections based on constructs like "Diversity of living things" or "Human physiology."</p>
<p>This systematic approach provides clarity for both examiners and candidates. The marking schemes are precisely developed
     around the criteria defined by each construct, ensuring fair and consistent evaluation of student performance. It allows 
     teachers to focus their instruction on these key thematic areas, moving away from a topic-by-topic, surface-level
      teaching method.</p>
