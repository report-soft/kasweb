  <h1>A Look at Schools Allowing Phones in Uganda</h1>
  <div class="feature-card sec2">
<p>The integration of technology into education is a global trend, and Uganda
is no exception. While the Ministry of Education and Sports officially <strong>maintains a ban on students using handheld mobile
 devices like phones and tablets</strong> in primary and secondary schools, a nuanced reality exists on the ground. The lack of a
  finalized national ICT policy has led some schools to implement their own guidelines, creating a patchwork of rules
   across the country.</p>
<h2>Ministry of Education Policy on Phones in Schools</h2>
<p>Currently, the official position of the Ministry of Education is that <strong>mobile phones are prohibited for learners in
     lower education levels</strong>. The fear among many stakeholders, including teachers and parents, is that these devices will
      lead to increased indiscipline, access to inappropriate content, and distraction from academic pursuits. The national
       chairperson of the Association of Secondary Schools Head Teachers in Uganda (ASSHU) has emphasized the <strong>need for clear regulations
        to prevent abuse of the technology</strong>.</p>
<p>However, the Ministry is in the process of developing a "Digital Agenda" and an ICT policy aimed at integrating digital
     learning and closing the digital divide. This forthcoming policy is expected to provide a framework for students to
      use mobile gadgets in schools, with regulations on device standards, internet filtering, and defined roles for all
       stakeholders.</p>
<h2>Schools in Uganda that Allow their Students to Carry Phones</h2>
<p>In the absence of a national policy, certain forward-thinking schools have taken the initiative to allow phone usage
     under specific, controlled conditions. These institutions often view the devices as essential tools for the new, hands-on,
      competence-based lower secondary curriculum, which requires students to conduct their own research and create their
       own notes. Notable schools include:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>International School of Uganda (ISU)</strong></li>
    <p>ISU does not allow mobile phones usage during the school day and students must keep their mobile devices in lockers or bags
        to prevent distractions. However, they recognize the importance of technology for learning and allow students to bring
        phones for educational purposes outside of class time.</p>
    </p>
    <li><strong>Hana International School</strong></li>
    <p>Hana International School requires parents who wish their children to keep mobile phones and other related gadgets to
        sign a <strong>mobile phones policy</strong>in line with Uganda's laws governing phone usage.</p>
    <li><strong>Kabojja International School</strong></li>
    <p>Allows mobile phones, computers, music players in boarding houses but students have to register them with administration 
        and media volume must be minimal.</p>
    <li><strong>Boston International School Uganda</strong></li>
    <p>Like Kabojja International School, Boston allows students to carry mobile phones and other electronics but confines their usage
        to boarding houses only and must be registered with school authorities.</p>
    </p>
    <li><strong>Rainbow International School</strong></li>
    <p>Mobile phones allowed for older students from Year 10 onwards, and depends on specific parent agreed policies.</p>

</ol>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Almost all International Schools in Uganda allow students to carry mobile phones. However, their are specific
policies agreed upon by parents on their usage.</p>

<h2>Other Ugandan Schools Policies on Mobile Phones</h2>
<p>Although most local secondary and high schools follow the Ministry's guidance on mobile phones and have prohibited their use by 
    students, there are a few local schools that allow students to carry mobile phones. These include Nakasero Secondary School, Vienna 
College Namugongo, & Mbale Secondary School.</p>
<h2>The Way Forward</h2>
<p>The debate over phones in Ugandan schools remains controversial. While some see the immense potential for technology to enhance
     learning and bridge resource gaps, others emphasize the significant risks of distraction and indiscipline.</p>
