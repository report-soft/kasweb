  <h1>Schools in Uganda that Allow Girls to Grow Hair & Plait it</h1>
  <div class="feature-card sec2">
    <p>In most schools in Uganda, students are not expected to keep hair above half an inch. This policy is explicitly stated in schools'
        Rules and Regulations, and hair is treated as part of school uniform. Plaiting, braiding, perming, keeping dreadlocks are all 
        prohibited for both girls and boys
    </p>
    <p><strong>Neatness & Hygiene</strong>: Schools advance maintaining neatness, hygiene, and preventing distractions as the rationale
    for these strict policies on hair.</p>
    <p>Some schools however have less strict policies on hair and allow students to keep their hair for as long as it's neat and tidy.
        Many Ugandan schools also allow foreign students whose culture does not favour cutting off hair, especially for girls.
    </p>
    <h2>Ministry of Education Policy on Hair</h2>
    <p>The Ministry of Education and Sports has no specific policy on hair in schools. It instead allows individual schools to establish
        their own rules regarding student appearance and grooming. These school-specific policies are however expected to align with the
         Ministry's general guidelines on discipline and moral conduct for schools.
    </p>
    <h2>Categories of Schools that Allow Hair</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Most muslim schools</strong>
        <p>Majority of muslim schools allow girls to keep hair for as long as they keep  it under a veil. It is easier for such 
                schools as the veil is mandatory for all girl students whether they are muslim or not.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>International Schools</strong>
        <p>All international schools allow students to keep hair. This is because they enrol multi-ethnic students who have diverse 
            cultures and may not be able to conform to the Ugandan accepted policies on hair in schools.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Elite Christian Schools</strong>
        <p>Many high-end schools, that are frequented by students from well-to-do Christian families, allow them to grow, plait and braid hair. 
            The founders and administration of these schools believe in student freedom.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Liberal Schools (follow trends)</strong>
        <p>These are regular schools that accept students the way they come.  They have no specific policy on student hair, students and 
            their parents decide whether to grow hair or not. Usually done as a student recruitment policy to draw high numbers of students.
