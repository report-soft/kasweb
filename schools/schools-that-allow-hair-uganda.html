  <h1>Secondary Schools in Uganda that Allow Girls to Grow, Plait & Braid their Hair</h1>
  <div class="feature-card sec2">
    
    <p>This post looks at secondary schools in Uganda that allow their students to grow, plait and braid hair. Although majority of
     Ugandan secondary schools prohibit students from keeping long hair, a number of schools allow students to keep their hair for as
      long as it's neat and tidy.</p>
    
    <h2>Categories of Ugandan Schools that Allow Students to Keep Long Hair</h2><br>
    <h3>Most muslim schools</h3>
        <p>Majority of muslim schools allow girls to keep hair for as long as they keep  it under a veil. It is easier for such 
                schools as the veil is mandatory for all girl students whether they are muslim or not.
        </p>
        <h3>International Schools</h3>
        <p>All international schools allow students to keep hair. This is because they enrol multi-ethnic students who have diverse 
            cultures and may not be able to conform to the Ugandan accepted policies on hair in schools.
        </p>
        <h3>Elite Christian Schools</h3>
        <p>Many high-end schools, that are frequented by students from well-to-do Christian families, allow them to grow, plait and braid hair. 
            The founders and administration of these schools believe in student freedom.
        </p>
        <h3>Liberal Schools (follow trends)</h3>
        <p>These are regular schools that accept students the way they come.  They have no specific policy on student hair, students and 
            their parents decide whether to grow hair or not. Usually done as a student recruitment policy to draw high numbers of students.

     <h2>Why these Ugandan Schools Allow Girls to Grow their Hair Long</h2><br>
    <h3>Cultural and Religious Considerations</h3>
      <p>Schools allow students to grow their hair long if it is part of their culture or religious tradition. In many muslim communities, 
      for example, girls are expected to keep their hair long. The Indian Sikh community in Uganda does not allow cutting students hair
      short.</p>
    <h3>Individual Rights and Expression</h3>
      <p>Some schools allow long hair to avoid restricting personal expression, especially for those schools that have a liberal dress
        code.
      </p>
      <h3>Long Hair has no Negative Impact on Performance</h3>
      <p>The belief that long hair hinders academic performance has be challenged by research which shows that students with longer hair 
        produce good results just like their counterparts with short hair.
      </p>
      <h3>Discrimation Issues</h3>
      <p>Schools find it difficult to enforce all girls to cut their hair. Some students have to be exempted from the hair rule
         because of their culture or religion. To ensure that the rest of the students do not feel discriminated, they allow all
         girls to grow their hair.
      </p>
    
    
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Some schools only allow Advanced Level (A-Level) students to grow hair.</p>

    <h2>Ministry of Education Policy on Hair in Schools</h2>
    <p>The Ministry of Education and Sports has no specific policy on hair in schools. It instead allows individual schools to establish
        their own rules regarding student appearance and grooming. These school-specific policies are however expected to align with the
         Ministry's general guidelines on discipline and moral conduct for schools.
