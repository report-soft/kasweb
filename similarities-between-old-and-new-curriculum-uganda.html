  <h1>Similarities Between the Old and the New Curriculum in Uganda</h1>
  <div class="feature-card sec2">
    <p>The introduction of the New Lower Secondary Curriculum in Uganda has brought major changes to how students are taught and assessed. However, beneath these changes lie several fundamental similarities with the old curriculum. Both systems share the same overarching goal — to prepare learners with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to contribute meaningfully to society.</p>

    <h2>1. Focus on Learning Outcomes</h2>
    <p>Both the old and new curricula emphasize what students should know and be able to do by the end of a learning cycle. The old curriculum focused on mastery of content knowledge, while the new curriculum goes a step further by integrating skills and values into the learning outcomes. Yet, the foundation — ensuring students learn — remains constant.</p>

    <h2>2. Teacher as a Facilitator</h2>
    <p>While the old system positioned teachers primarily as knowledge transmitters, it also recognized the teacher’s role in guiding students. The new curriculum formalizes this by promoting learner-centered teaching. In both, teachers are key in shaping learners’ academic growth and discipline.</p>

    <h2>3. Assessment as a Learning Tool</h2>
    <p>Assessment has always been central to Uganda’s education system. The difference lies in how it is implemented. The old system relied heavily on end-of-term exams, while the new one incorporates continuous assessment. Yet, both use evaluation to measure learning and track progress.</p>

    <h2>4. The Role of NCDC and UNEB</h2>
    <p>Both curricula are designed and overseen by the National Curriculum Development Centre (NCDC) and assessed under the guidelines of UNEB. These institutions ensure standardization, quality, and fairness in Uganda’s education system.</p>

    <h2>5. Supportive Tools Like Shuleni</h2>
    <p>Whether under the old or new curriculum, schools need efficient systems for recording, analyzing, and reporting learner performance. <strong>Shuleni Report Card Management Software</strong> bridges this gap perfectly. It simplifies grading, supports the new continuous assessment structure, and ensures reports reflect both academic and generic skills.</p>

    <h2>6. Shared Objective — Holistic Education</h2>
    <p>Both curricula recognize that education is more than passing exams. They aim to nurture creativity, integrity, and problem-solving ability — preparing learners for life beyond the classroom. The difference is that the new curriculum puts this philosophy into daily practice through competence-based activities.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The similarities between the old and new curricula show that Uganda’s education reform is evolutionary rather than revolutionary. It builds on past experiences while improving relevance and practicality. With <strong>Shuleni</strong>, schools can transition smoothly between the two, ensuring continuity, accuracy, and compliance with NCDC standards.</p>
