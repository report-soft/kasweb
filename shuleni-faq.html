      <h1>Shuleni - Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <div class="feature-card sec2">
          <h2>What is Shuleni and how does it help schools manage report cards?</h2>
          <p>Shuleni is an <strong>offline report card management system</strong> built for schools that want to simplify 
          how they record, process, and print student results. Instead of using Excel or manual entry books, teachers 
          can enter marks directly into the <i>Shuleni</i> offline Desktop application, calculate averages automatically,
         and generate professional PDF report cards in seconds.</p>
         <p>Shuleni helps <strong>secondary school and primary schools </strong>in Uganda to reduce paperwork, save time, 
          and ensure accuracy in report card preparation. Every report card includes grades, descriptors, generic skills, 
        AOI scores, and Project scores.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-card sec2">

            and download compiled results for record keeping.
          </p>
          <p>The system works through a Windows desktop application that can be accessed on school and personal computers. Data
             is stored securely, and you can also import or export from Excel or CSV files, making Shuleni easy to integrate with
