    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>In 2015, I was approached by my school headteacher with a request to help with report card processing and 
      generation. Back then I didn't know anything about programming. I used the available technology I was conversant 
      with - Microsoft Office Excel. I designed a report card template in Microsoft Office Word and used the Mail Merge 
      feature to access the students marksheet from Excel. That was the begining of my journey in report card software 
      design.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>The Excel-based Report Card generation program worked well for some time but it eventually became difficult
      to manage and maintain. The first problem manifested in the fact that Excel formulas were difficult to maintain
      and follow up. In case number of subjects, number of students, or grading scales changed, the formulas had to be
      manually changed. There was also a challenge that since Excel formulas are exposed, they can easily be tampered with
      by mistake or maliciously. 
    </p>
    <p>The other challenge was that the program relied on Excel and Word. An expired Ms Office would mean the report
      card system wouldn't work. Finally, Excel and Word had many distracting functionalities that were not required 
      for our school report card software.

    <h2>The Birth of Shuleni Report Card Management System</h2>
    <p>Issues with the Excel-based Report Card System prompted me to learn programming especially Javascript, Javascript 
      frameworks like nodejs & Reactjs, and Python. At first I was tempted to create an online report card system but majority
      of the pilot schools complained about internet connectivity. I therefore embarked on designing a standalone, oflline,
      desktop application that would accept raw students records and turn them into professional-looking report cards. 
      That's how <strong>Shuleni Report Card Management System</strong> was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between 2020 and 2021, I met tech enthusiasts <strong><em>Nfumba Joshua</em></strong>, <strong><em>Brian Ssematimba</em></strong> 
      and <strong><em>Kizza Joseph</em></strong> who shared my vision for an offline report card system.  It's with these three that I 
      designed and developed Shuleni Report Card Management System from scatch. 
    </p>
    <p>Shuleni was our way of trying to solve challenges schools meet in processing and generating report cards for
       their students. We designed it to ease installation, data (students marks) entry, assessment records keeping, 
       assessment records sharing, streamline grading, and reduce errors in school reporting.</p>

      for Windows PCs running Windows 10 and later. It's a lightweight desktop application that completely runs offline 
      and is available on a Pay-Once-Use-Forever basis - does not need a monthly/termly subscription
