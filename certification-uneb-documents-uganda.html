  <h1>UNEB Certification of Documents</h1>
  <div class="feature-card sec2">
    <img src="../images/release-of-uneb-uce.jpg" alt="UNEB Exedcutive Director - Dan Odong">
<p>It is not possible to certify UNEB documents directly, as the Uganda National Examinations Board (UNEB) no longer
     issues duplicate academic certificates. Instead, individuals and institutions must apply for an official 
     "Letter of Verification" of results. This document serves as proof of a candidate's results and can be certified by
      the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) for official use, particularly for those applying for opportunities abroad.</p>
    <p>The UNEB Letter of Verification is issued in case of loss/damage, Verification or Confirmation of PLE, UCE & UACE result
       slips and certificates</p>
    <h2>The procedure for individual applicants</h2>
    <p>If you are an individual requiring a letter of verification, the process can be completed through UNEB's
         e-Services portal. You will need the following documentation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A scanned letter of introduction addressed to the Executive Secretary of UNEB from the candidate's former school.</li><br>
        <li>A scanned, valid form of identification, such as a national ID or passport.</li><br>
        <li>If the original result slip or certificate was lost or damaged, a scanned letter from the police reporting the loss.</li><br>
        <li>For applications submitted on behalf of another person, a letter of authorization from the candidate is required, 
            along with a copy of their identity document.</li><br>
        <li>Scanned copies of the documents to be verified.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to apply</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Access the e-Services portal</strong>: Visit the UNEB e-Services website and select the "Apply for Letters of
             Verification As an Individual" option.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Complete the application</strong>: Fill out the required information and upload the necessary documents. Remember that the
             maximum file size for uploads is 2MB, so you may need to reduce the size of your images.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Choose the document type</strong>: Select whether you need an "Ordinary Letter" or a "Hard-Card Letter" 
            (a substitute for a lost certificate).</li><br>
        <li><strong>Pay the fee</strong>: An invoice will be generated for the processing fee. As of an April 2025, fees are
             UGX 50,000 for an ordinary letter and UGX 100,000 for a hard card, with higher fees for special 
             political documents. Payments can be made via mobile money or bank deposit.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Await confirmation</strong>: UNEB will process the request and you will receive notifications about the progress.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>The procedure for certifying the letter at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</h2>
    <p>After UNEB has processed your request and delivered the letter of verification, you can get it officially 
        certified by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA). This is essential for documents that will be used internationally.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>UNEB delivery</strong>: In some cases, UNEB can deliver the verification letter directly to the Ministry of 
                Foreign Affairs for further processing.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Make URA payment</strong>: Pay the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) fee, which is UGX 20,000 per certified copy.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Submit documents to MoFA</strong>: Take your UNEB verification letter (and the original certificate or pass 
                slip if available) to the MoFA for stamping. You may also need to present your passport.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Wait for the process to be completed</strong>: MoFA staff will stamp the document, officially certifying its contents.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Important considerations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>No duplicate certificates: It is crucial to remember that UNEB does not issue replacement certificates. 
                The letter of verification is the official document provided in cases of loss or damage.</li><br>
            <li>Equating foreign results: The equating of foreign academic qualifications is a separate service offered by UNEB.
                 This process is for individuals with international documents who need them to be assessed against the Ugandan
                  academic standard.</li><br>
            <li>Verification is key: When an institution or employer requests a certified UNEB document, they are typically 
                seeking official verification directly from the source. The Letter of Verification and its subsequent certification 
                by MoFA fulfil this requirement effectively.</li>
        </ul>
