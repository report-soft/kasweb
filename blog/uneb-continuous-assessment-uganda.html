  <h1>Handling of UNEB UCE Continuous Assessment</h1>
  <div class="feature-card sec2">
    <img src="../images/uneb-amis-registration-software.png" alt="UNEB AMIS Software for Continuous Assessment">
   <p>Uganda's education system is undergoing transformation with the adoption of a new competence-based curriculum. 
    At the heart of this reform is the introduction of continuous assessment (CA), a process designed to more accurately measure
     a learner's abilities throughout their educational journey. Under this system, continuous assessment now accounts for 
     20% of a candidate's final grade in the Uganda Certificate of Education (UCE), with the final written exam making up the
      remaining 80%.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the new system includes project work, which is assessed separately and appears on the final UCE certificate.
         This provides a clear record of a student's creative and practical competencies. The submission of CA scores and 
         project work is now a mandatory prerequisite for a candidate's full registration for the UCE examinations.</p>
         
    <h2>Capturing UNEB Continuous Assessment Data</h2>
    <p>Schools are required to capture continuous assessment data for each candidate using the UNEB Assessment Management 
      Information System (AMIS). This involves registering the student in S.3 and entering the following scores into AMIS:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Activities of Integration Scores (S.3 Term I, II, III & S.4 Term I, II)</li><br>
        <li>Project Achievement scores (from Project work Checklist)</li><br>
        <li>Subject Achievement scores (from Observation Checklists)</li>
    </ol>
    <img src="../images/uneb-uce-subject-achievement.png" alt="UCE Subject Achievement Scores entry">
    <p>Activities of Integration scores are got from AOI tests administered to students at the end of each topic, Project 
        Achievement scores are compiled from any one of the projects carried out by the student in S.3 - S.4, and the Subject
         Achievement scores are compliled from each teacher's observation of the student's participation their subject.</p>
    <p>Subject Achievement Observation checklists and Project Achievement checklists can be downloaded from the UNEB Assessment 
        Management Information System (AMIS) software or from the UNEB eReg portal.</p>
    <p>Data entered into AMIS can be output through printing reports for each subject. An excel file is generated and has to be
        submitted to UNEB via the UNEB eReg portal.
    </p>
    <h2>Submission of Continuous Assessment Data to UNEB</h2>
    <img src="../images/uneb-ca-upload-dashboard.png" alt="uneb ca upload dashboard">
    <p>Once the continuous assessment data has been captured in AMIS, schools must submit this information to UNEB through 
      the UNEB eReg portal. The submission process involves the following steps:</p>    
    <ol>
        <li>Log in to the UNEB eReg portal using the school's credentials.</li><br>
        <li>Navigate to the UCE Continuous Assessment submission section.</li><br>
        <li>Upload the continuous assessment data (Excel file) from AMIS to the portal.</li><br>
        <li>Verify that all the CA data collected is accurate.</li><br>
        <li>Submit the data to UNEB.</li><br>
    </ol>
    <p>Note: The eReg Portal gives the school access to the uploaded Continuous Assessment data. The headteacher/deputy headteacher
        can view, download, edit and re-submit the CA data before the final submission deadline.</p>
    <h2>Important Deadlines and Considerations</h2>
    <p>Submission of CA data for the Term is usually done during the holidays. The deadlines for submission are therefore by the
         end of the school Term holidays or a few days after resumption. Schools must adhere to these deadlines to ensure that their
          candidates are fully registered for the UCE examinations.</p>
