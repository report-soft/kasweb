  <h1>Handling of UNEB UCE Continuous Assessment</h1>
  <div class="feature-card sec2">
  
    <P>Uganda's New Curriculum requires secondary schools to submit UCE Continuous Assessment to Uganda National Examinations Board (UNEB). 
      Continuous Assessment is designed to more accurately measure a learner's abilities throughout their Lower Secondary journey. Under
       this system, continuous assessment now accounts for 20% of a candidate's final grade in the Uganda Certificate of Education
        (UCE), with the final written exam making up the remaining 80%.
    </P>
    <h2>Project Work as Continuous Assessment</h2>
    <p>The new system includes project work, which is assessed separately and appears on the final UCE 
      certificate. This provides a clear record of a student's creative and practical competencies. UNEB now requires secondary schools
      to submit Continuous Assessment scores and project work as a mandatory prerequisite for a candidate's full registration for
       the UCE examinations.</p>
  
  
    <h2>Capturing UNEB Continuous Assessment Data</h2>
    <p>Schools are required to capture continuous assessment data for each candidate using the UNEB Assessment Management 
      Information System (AMIS). This involves registering the student in S.3 and entering the following scores into AMIS:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Activities of Integration Scores (S.3 Term I, II, III & S.4 Term I, II)</li><br>
        <li>Project Achievement scores (from Project work Checklist)</li><br>
        <li>Subject Achievement scores (from Observation Checklists)</li>
    </ol>
   
    <h2>How UNEB UCE Continuous Assessment Scores are Generated</h2>
    <p>Activities of Integration scores are got from AOI tests administered to students at the end of each topic, Project 
        Achievement scores are compiled from any one of the projects carried out by the student in S.3 - S.4, and the Subject
         Achievement scores are compliled from each teacher's observation of the student's participation their subject.</p>
    <h2>Accessing UNEB UCE Continuous Assessment Checklists</h2>
    <p>Subject Achievement Observation checklists and Project Achievement checklists can be downloaded from the UNEB Assessment 
        Management Information System (AMIS) software or from the UNEB eReg portal. On the eRegistration portal, the term's 
        checklists are posted on the dashboard and can be downloaded in a single click.</p>
    <p>Data entered into AMIS can be output through printing reports for each subject. An excel file is generated and has to be
        submitted to UNEB via the UNEB eReg portal.
    </p>
    <h2>Submission of UCE Continuous Assessment Data to UNEB</h2>
    
    <p>Once the continuous assessment data has been captured in AMIS, schools must submit this information to UNEB through 
      the UNEB eReg portal. The submission process involves the following steps:</p>    
    <ol>
        <li>Log in to the UNEB eReg portal using the school's credentials.</li><br>
        <li>Navigate to the UCE Continuous Assessment submission section.</li><br>
        <li>Upload the continuous assessment data (Excel file) from AMIS to the portal.</li><br>
        <li>Verify that all the CA data collected is accurate.</li><br>
        <li>Submit the data to UNEB.</li><br>
    </ol>
    <p>Note: The eReg Portal gives the school access to the uploaded Continuous Assessment data. The headteacher/deputy headteacher
        can view, download, edit and re-submit the CA data before the final submission deadline.</p>
    <h2>Deadline for Submission of UCE Continuous Assessment to UNEB</h2>
    <p>Submission of CA data for the Term is usually done during the holidays. The deadlines for submission are therefore by the
         end of the school Term holidays or a few days after resumption. Schools must adhere to these deadlines to ensure that their
          candidates are fully registered for the UCE examinations.</p>
