  <h1>New Curriculum A Level Combinations in Uganda</h1>
  <div class="feature-card sec2">
    <p>Uganda’s National Curriculum Development Centre (NCDC) has produced an updated A-Level (Advanced) syllabus aligned
       to the competency-based Lower Secondary Curriculum (LSC). The revised A-level is learner-centred, inquiry-based
        and aims to ease transition from the new O-level/Lower Secondary CBC.</p>
    <p>Implementation has been <strong>phased and politically contested</strong>: a full new A-Level overhaul was in development, but in
       late 2024 the government of Uganda shelved the earlier proposal and directed an abridged/adapted A-Level syllabus for the
        cohort entering Senior 5 in 2025, with further rollouts planned later.</p>
    <h2>Why the Change</h2>
    <p>The New A-Level Curriculum has been brought to align advanced-level teaching with the competence-based approach 
      introduced at lower secondary (LSC), so learners follow a coherent pedagogy across Senior 1–6. The A-level update 
      emphasizes learner-centred methods, inquiry, hands-on experiences and real-life applications.</p>
    <p>The change is also aimed at reducing mismatches between what lower secondary produces (competences) and what 
      traditional A-level expected (content-heavy, exam-driven), and to provide flexible progression pathways.</p>
    <h2>What’s in the new/adapted A-Level curriculum</h2>
    <p><strong>Two-year Advanced level (Senior 5 & 6)</strong> remains the core structure, but the syllabi are revised to
       be competency-based and to emphasize skills and applications rather than rote content. Several subject syllabi have
        been revised.</p>
    <p><strong>Number of Subjects</strong>: The NCDC lists around 29 subjects to be offered in A Level. Schools continue to 
      offer combinations (science & arts, ), but some specific content/topics have been removed or abridged to ease the transition.</p>
    <p><strong>Pedagogy</strong>: Emphasis on inquiry-based learning, practicals, project/problem solving, cross-cutting 
      competencies and assessment for learning approaches rather than purely summative content coverage.</p>
    <h2>New Curriculum A-Level Combinations</h2>
    <p>The Advanced Level Combinations structure has not changed from the previous 3 Principal subjects and 2 Subsidiary subjects. 
      A level students can therefore offer popular combinations including the following:</p>
      <h2>Sciences Combinations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>PCM</strong>: Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics</li><br>
        <li><strong>PCB</strong>: Physics, Chemistry, Biology</li><br>
        <li><strong>BCM</strong>: Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics</li><br>
        <li><strong>PEM</strong>: Physics, Economics, Mathematics</li><br>
        <li><strong>BCA</strong>: Biology, Chemistry, Agriculture</li><br>
        <li><strong>PAM</strong>: Physics, Agriculture, Mathematics</li><br>
        <li><strong>PCA</strong>: Physics, Chemistry, Agriculture </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Arts Combinations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>HEG</strong>: History, Economics, Geography</li><br>
        <li><strong>HEL</strong>: History, Economics, Literature</li><br>
        <li><strong>HEL</strong>: History, Literature, Divinity</li><br>
        <li><strong>HEL</strong>: Divinity, Economics, Geography</li><br>
        <li><strong>LEA</strong>: Literature, Economics, Art </li>
      </ul>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Subsidiary Subjects include <strong>ICT, Sub-Maths, and General Paper</strong>.</p>
    <p>Combinations vary from school to school but follow the same pattern. It is however important that students to select
       combinations for which they have achieved good grades in their Lower Secondary exams.</p>
