  <h1>Release dates for UNEB's PLE, UCE & UACE Results</h1>
  <div class="feature-card sec2">
  
<p>The release of national examination results by the Uganda National Examinations Board (UNEB) is an annual event that commands
     national attention. For hundreds of thousands of candidates, parents, and educators, the period following the final exams is
      a mixture of anxiety and eager anticipation. The exact dates for the release of results for the Primary Leaving Examination
       (PLE), Uganda Certificate of Education (UCE), and Uganda Advanced Certificate of Education (UACE) are not set in stone but
        follow a predictable pattern.</p>
    <h2>The official announcement process</h2>
    <p>UNEB, together with the Ministry of Education and Sports, follows a strict protocol for the release of results. 
        The final decision on the release date is a collaborative one, but the public announcement is made by the Minister of
         Education and Sports, often preceded by an official briefing from UNEB. This briefing to the minister, typically held
          at State House, precedes the public announcement by a day or two.</p>
    <p>The announcement is broadcast and streamed live on various public radio and television stations, as well as on UNEB's official
         social media platforms. Any announcements of dates through unofficial channels, particularly on social media, should be treated with caution, as UNEB has previously had to debunk fake announcements.</p>
    <h2>Timeline for results release</h2>
    <p>Based on historical data and the typical examination schedule, UNEB follows a consistent timeline for releasing results.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Primary Leaving Examination (PLE): Following exams that typically conclude in early November, PLE results are usually the
             first to be released. These results often come out in mid-to-late January of the following year. For example, the 2024 
             PLE results were released in January 2025.</li><br>
        <li>Uganda Certificate of Education (UCE): With exams wrapping up around mid-October, UCE results generally follow PLE, with 
            a release in February. The release of the 2024 UCE results in February 2025 is a recent example. It is worth noting that 
            the transition to the new curriculum and its assessment methods may slightly influence future timelines.</li><br>
        <li>Uganda Advanced Certificate of Education (UACE): The UACE examinations, which conclude in November, are the last set of 
            results to be released. They typically come out in March of the following year. For instance, the 2024 UACE results were
             released in March 2025.</li>

    </ul>
