  <h1>Equating Foreign Results with UNEB</h1>
  <div class="feature-card sec2">
<p>For Ugandan students who studied abroad and foreign students trying to join Ugandan educational institutions, equating their foreign 
    qualifications is very crucial. <strong>Equating</strong> is the process of determining the value of foreign academic qualifications against recognized 
    national academic qualifications. In Uganda, Equating is done by the Uganda National Examinations Board (UNEB) and the National Council 
    for Higher Education (NCHE).</p>
    <h2>Why equating is necessary</h2>
    <p>Equating is crucial for standardizing the evaluation of academic achievement. Because grading systems, curricula, and 
        standards vary between countries, UNEB's role is to compare foreign qualifications to Uganda's standards, including the 
        Primary Leaving Examinations (PLE), Uganda Certificate of Education (UCE), and Uganda Advanced Certificate of Education
         (UACE). This process gives students a clear and recognized pathway into further education, employment, or other opportunities
          in Uganda.</p>
    <p>It's important to note that UNEB handles only primary and secondary-level results. Equating for post-secondary and higher
         education qualifications, such as diplomas and degrees, is handled by the National Council for Higher Education (NCHE).</p>
    <h2>The application process: A step-by-step guide</h2>
    <p>UNEB has streamlined its application process through its e-Services portal, allowing applicants to submit most documents online.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Online application</strong>: The process begins by filling out an application form on the UNEB e-Services portal
             (eservices.uneb.ac.ug).</li><br>
        <li><strong>Document submission</strong>: Applicants must upload a fully completed and signed Declaration Form, which is available for download 
            on the portal. They must also include a clear copy of a valid identification document, such as a passport or national ID.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Verification letter</strong>: The most critical and often longest step is requesting a verified copy of the academic results directly 
            from the foreign examining body. The examining body must email this verified copy directly to UNEB at equating@uneb.ac.ug. 
            For students from specific countries like South Sudan, Sudan, Somalia, Eritrea, and Ethiopia, verification can be obtained 
            through their respective embassies in Kampala.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Translation of documents</strong>: If the academic certificates were not issued in English, UNEB requires them to be translated by 
            the Centre for Languages and Communication Services at Makerere University, at the applicant's expense.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Payment of fees</strong>: Once UNEB has verified the documents, the applicant will receive an invoice. The fees are 200,000 Ugandan
             Shillings for qualifications from East Africa and 250,000 shillings for those from outside the region. Payment can be 
             made via mobile money or bank deposit.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>What to expect after applying</h2>
    <p>After payment, the equating process takes a minimum of five working days. UNEB will send notifications via email and SMS 
        to keep the applicant updated on the progress.</p>
    <p>The equated documents are sent directly to the institution that requested them. It is crucial to provide the correct contact
         information for both the institution that awarded the qualification and the institution that requires the equated results. 
         It is also important for applicants to be honest during the process, as UNEB is not liable for any forgeries or alterations
          of submitted results.</p>
