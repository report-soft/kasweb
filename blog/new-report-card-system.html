      <h1>The UNEB UCE Grading System for the Competence Based Curriculum (CBC)</h1>
        <div class="feature-card sec2">
        <p>The release of the 2024 Uganda Certificate of Education (UCE) results ushered in a new era of assessment under
             the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC). With the old 1–9 stanine grading system replaced by letter grades (A–E)
              and no more division rankings, schools and parents were left with new questions.</p>
        <p>This significant shift means more than just new letters on a report card. It represents a fundamental change in
             how UNEB reports student achievement. For schools relying on traditional manual processes, this new format can
              be a challenge. But with a powerful report card management system like Shuleni, schools can easily adapt and thrive.</p>
        <h2>What is different about the new UCE grading?</h2>
        <p>Under the new CBC framework, UNEB has moved away from a system that primarily ranked students based on their final exam
             performance. The new grading system provides a more holistic and descriptive view of a student’s acquired skills and 
             competencies.</p>
        <p>Here is a breakdown of the key changes:
            <ul>
                <li>Abolition of division rankings: Instead of being grouped into divisions, students are now assessed on 
                    their individual achievement levels.</li><br>
                <li>Shift from stanine to letter grades: The old numerical grades have been replaced with a letter grading 
                    scale from A (Exceptional) to E (Elementary).</li><br>
                <li>Competency-focused descriptors: Each letter grade is accompanied by a descriptor that explains what a student
                     at that level is capable of doing in real-life situations. For example:
                    <ul><br>
                        <li>A: Exceptional - Demonstrates innovative and creative application of knowledge.</li><br>
                        <li>B: Outstanding - Demonstrates a high level of competence.</li><br>
                        <li>C: Satisfactory - Shows an adequate level of competence.</li><br>
                        <li>D: Basic - Achieves a minimum level of competence.</li><br>
                        <li>E: Elementary - Achieves a below-basic level of competence.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li>No more "Fail": There is no longer a "fail" grade. The lowest grade, E, still describes a student's competencies.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>The challenge for schools in the new era</h2>
        <p>Adapting to the new UNEB grading system is a crucial task for all secondary schools in Uganda. The move to a competency-based
             report card requires a reporting tool that goes beyond simple calculations. It demands a system that can accurately:
            <ul>
                <li>Incorporate and calculate Continuous Assessment (CA) scores and end-of-cycle marks.</li><br>
                <li>Generate reports with the correct letter grades and their descriptive explanations.</li><br>
                <li>Present project work as a stand-alone item on the certificat</li><br>
                <li>Organize this new, more descriptive data efficiently.</li>

            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>For schools using manual methods, this means extra time and effort from teachers and administration, increasing 
                the risk of errors and inconsistencies.</p>
            <h2>How Shuleni simplifies the new UNEB grading</h2>
            <p>This is where a robust report card management system like Shuleni becomes essential. Shuleni was built to meet the 
                specific needs of Ugandan secondary schools, including the new CBC assessment model.</p>
            <p>Here's how Shuleni makes the transition seamless:
                 <ul>
                <li>Automated calculations: The system automatically computes student totals, averages, and ranks, eliminating
                     manual calculations and reducing errors.</li><br>
                <li>Flexible report card templates: Shuleni's software comes with pre-configured templates that align with the
                     new UNEB requirements, ensuring every report card is accurate and compliant.</li><br>
                <li>One-click PDF generation: With a single click, schools can generate printable PDF report cards, complete
                     with the school logo and the headteacher’s signature area.</li><br>
                <li>Offline functionality: For schools with unreliable internet access, Shuleni's offline capabilities allow 
                    for uninterrupted report card generation.</li><br>
                <li>Detailed analytics: Shuleni doesn't just print reports; it provides valuable analytics on class averages and
                     subject performance, helping teachers and administrators identify students who need extra support.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>A smooth transition to competency-based reporting</h2>
            <p>The new UNEB grading system marks a positive step towards a more comprehensive and meaningful assessment of 
                student potential. However, adapting to this change requires the right tools.</p>
            <p>With Shuleni, schools can confidently navigate the new system, saving valuable time and ensuring that every
                     report card accurately reflects a student’s true competence.</p>
