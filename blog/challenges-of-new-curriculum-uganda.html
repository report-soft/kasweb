  <h1>Challenges of the New Curriculum in Uganda</h1>
  <div class="feature-card sec2">
    <p>The introduction of the <strong>new competence-based curriculum in Uganda</strong> by the National Curriculum Development Centre (NCDC) was intended to make learning more practical, engaging, and relevant. However, many schools, teachers, and learners continue to face serious implementation challenges. From limited resources to lack of digital tools, these hurdles slow down the full adoption of the new approach.</p>

    <h2>1. Limited Teacher Training</h2>
    <p>Many teachers were trained under the old curriculum and have not yet fully adapted to the competence-based system. Some struggle to interpret learning outcomes and assess competencies effectively. Without continuous professional development, this gap continues to widen. <strong>Shuleni Report Card System</strong> helps bridge this gap by offering a clear digital structure for recording and assessing competencies.</p>

    <h2>2. Inadequate Teaching Materials</h2>
    <p>Several schools lack the instructional materials required to deliver practical lessons. Laboratories, ICT tools, and project materials are insufficient in many rural schools. This limits the ability of learners to engage in hands-on activities — a key feature of the new curriculum.</p>

    <h2>3. Heavy Workload for Teachers</h2>
    <p>Continuous assessment requires teachers to record student progress throughout the term. This can become overwhelming without proper management systems. With <strong>Shuleni</strong>, teachers can enter marks once and automatically generate competence-based reports, saving hours of manual work.</p>

    <h2>4. Inconsistent Assessment Practices</h2>
    <p>Different schools interpret the curriculum differently. Some still use exam-style assessments instead of the required performance-based evaluations. Tools like <strong>Shuleni Report Card System</strong> ensure uniformity by following NCDC’s official assessment format and descriptors.</p>

    <h2>5. Insufficient ICT Infrastructure</h2>
    <p>The integration of technology in teaching and learning is still low, especially in upcountry schools. Yet, the new curriculum demands that learners develop digital literacy. Schools using Shuleni, however, gain a major advantage — a simple, offline-friendly tool that supports digital reporting even without constant internet access.</p>

    <h2>6. Low Parental Awareness</h2>
    <p>Many parents still expect traditional grades and term exams, not realizing that the new system values <em>skills and competencies</em>. Teachers spend time explaining assessment reports instead of focusing on teaching. <strong>Shuleni’s clear report card format</strong> helps communicate progress more effectively to parents.</p>

    <h2>How Shuleni Simplifies Curriculum Implementation</h2>
    <p>Shuleni is designed for Ugandan schools adapting to the new curriculum. It automates score entry, calculates average competencies, and generates clear, branded report cards. Teachers can manage Continuous Assessment (CAI) data, performance levels, and term summaries all in one platform — ensuring compliance with NCDC guidelines.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The challenges of Uganda’s new curriculum are real — but with the right tools and mindset, schools can overcome them. Training, collaboration, and digital systems like <strong>Shuleni Report Card Management Software</strong> will ensure smoother adoption and improved learning outcomes for all students.</p>
