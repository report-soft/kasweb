  <h1>Compulsory Subjects in the New Curriculum in Uganda</h1>
  <div class="feature-card sec2">
<p>Uganda's education system is undergoing a significant transformation with the introduction of 
    a new Lower Secondary Curriculum (LSC). The reform, rolled out in 2020, moves away from the traditional, 
    knowledge-based approach to a competency-based model. This shift emphasizes equipping students with critical
     21st-century skills like creativity, critical thinking, and collaboration. A key component of this change is
      the revised structure of compulsory subjects for all students.</p>
<h2>The new curriculum's subject structure</h2>
<p>Under the new LSC, the number of total subjects has been reduced from 43 to 21 to ease the content load on 
    students and promote deeper learning. The structure for students in Senior One (S1) and Senior Two (S2) involves
     studying 12 subjects, with 11 designated as compulsory and one as an elective. As students progress to Senior 
     Three (S3) and Senior Four (S4), they focus on a minimum of eight and a maximum of nine subjects, with seven of
      these being compulsory.</p>
    <p>The list of new curriculum compulsory subjects has been updated to reflect the reform's focus on practical
         skills and holistic development.</p>
    <h2>The compulsory subjects for S1 and S2 include:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>English</li>
        <li>Mathematics</li>
        <li>History and Political Education</li>
        <li>Geography</li>
        <li>Biology</li>
        <li>Chemistry</li>
        <li>Physics</li>
        <li>Physical Education</li>
        <li>Religious Education (either Christian Religious Education or Islamic Religious Education)</li>
        <li>Entrepreneurship</li>
        <li>Kiswahili</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>For students in S3 and S4, the compulsory subjects are:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>English</li>
        <li>Mathematics</li>
        <li>History and Political Education</li>
        <li>Geography</li>
        <li>Biology</li>
        <li>Chemistry</li>
        <li>Physics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Elective subjects are chosen based on a student's interests and potential career paths, allowing for specialization.</p>
    <h2>Continuous assessment and the UNEB UCE</h2>
    <p>The new syllabus also introduces a fundamental shift in how student performance is assessed. Previously, performance
         was judged almost entirely on final examinations set by the Uganda National Examinations Board (UNEB). 
         Now, a student's final UCE grade is determined by a continuous assessment component, which contributes 20% to
          the overall score, and the final national exam. This approach aims to promote consistent engagement and a deeper 
          understanding of the subjects, rather than rote memorization for exams.</p>
    <h2>Navigating the new curriculum with Shuleni</h2>
    <p>The complexities of the new curriculum's assessment model, particularly the continuous assessment and the updated report
         card format, can be challenging for schools to manage manually. This is where modern school management tools become 
         invaluable. <strong>Shuleni Report Card Software </strong>is a local solution designed specifically to help schools and administrators 
         manage the new system efficiently.</p>
    <p>Shuleni automates the process of computing scores, generating detailed reports that capture competencies and generic skills, 
        and creating professional PDF report cards in seconds. Its offline functionality is especially useful for schools in rural 
        areas with limited internet access. By automating tedious administrative tasks, Shuleni allows teachers to focus more on
         teaching and empowers school administrators to ensure compliance with the new syllabus guidelines.</p>
