  <h1>How is the New Curriculum in Uganda?</h1>
  <div class="feature-card sec2">
    <p>The new curriculum in Uganda, introduced by the NCDC, is a competence-based approach aimed at developing students’ skills, creativity, and problem-solving abilities. Unlike the old system that focused on exams and rote memorization, the new curriculum evaluates students holistically. With <strong>Shuleni Report Card System</strong>, schools can efficiently record, calculate, and generate detailed report cards reflecting this new structure.</p>

    <h2>Structure of the New Curriculum</h2>
    <p>The curriculum is divided into subject competencies, generic skills, and co-curricular activities. Students are assessed in areas such as critical thinking, communication, ICT literacy, and values, in addition to academic knowledge. Continuous assessment makes up part of the final grade, ensuring that effort and participation are recognized.</p>

    <h2>Assessment Methods</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Continuous assessment through classwork, projects, and activities (CAI)</li>
      <li>Scenario-based and practical questions to evaluate skills</li>
      <li>Competency-based scoring for each subject area</li>
      <li>Regular feedback to students and parents via structured reports</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Shuleni Supports Schools</h2>
    <p>Managing this complex assessment manually is challenging. Shuleni simplifies the process by automating calculations, storing student scores, and generating comprehensive reports aligned with NCDC guidelines. Teachers can focus on instruction, while parents get a clear picture of student progress.</p>

    <h2>Benefits for Students and Parents</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Transparent and detailed assessment of student abilities</li>
      <li>Early identification of weak areas for timely intervention</li>
      <li>Improved communication between school and home</li>
      <li>Supports holistic development beyond exams</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The new curriculum in Uganda emphasizes competence, creativity, and holistic development. By adopting <strong>Shuleni Report Card Management System</strong>, schools can manage these assessments efficiently, helping students succeed while keeping parents informed and engaged.</p>
