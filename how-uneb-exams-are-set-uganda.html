  <h1>How UNEB Exams are set</h1>
  <div class="feature-card sec2">
   
    <p>To produce fair, standardized, and secure national examinations, the Uganda National Examinations Board (UNEB) follows a rigorous
         and confidential multi-stage process. While the exact details are a closely guarded secret to prevent malpractice, the overall 
         cycle involves several key steps from question development to printing. This process applies to the Primary Leaving 
         Examinations (PLE), Uganda Certificate of Education (UCE), and Uganda Advanced Certificate of Education (UACE), ensuring 
         national educational standards are upheld.</p>
    <h2>The process of setting UNEB exams</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Identifying and training examiners</strong></li>
        <p>UNEB recruits experienced and qualified teachers with a proven record of integrity to serve as examiners for specific subjects.
             These examiners are responsible for developing the initial questions. To ensure the quality and consistency of the questions, 
             UNEB trains new examiners and provides ongoing professional development for seasoned staff.</p>
        <li><strong>Question paper preparation</strong></li>
        <p>This is a comprehensive stage involving several confidential steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Question setting</strong>: Examiners develop new questions based on the national curriculum and the specific syllabus for each 
                subject and level (PLE, UCE, UACE).</li><br>
            <li><strong>Moderation</strong>: Subject panels review the set questions to ensure they are clear, unambiguous, and appropriate in difficulty. 
                The questions are moderated to remove any form of bias and ensure they align with the examination blueprint.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Compilation</strong>: The moderated questions are compiled into examination papers, carefully arranged according to the paper's
                 structure and instructions.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Typesetting and proofing</strong>: The final compilation is meticulously typeset and proofread by a different team to eliminate any
                 errors before the questions are "banked".</li>
        </ul><br>
        <li><strong>The confidential "banking" of questions</strong></li>
        <p>The final, vetted questions are stored in a highly secure and confidential "bank." This vault of questions is protected by
             strict security protocols and ensures that the exam questions cannot be leaked before the examination date. From this bank,
              new combinations of questions are compiled each year.</p>
        <li><strong>Secure printing and packing</strong></li>
        <p>UNEB owns a secure, in-house printing facility where examination papers are produced under maximum security. Staff involved 
            in the printing process are confined to a hostel within the facility until printing is complete. This minimizes the risk of 
            security breaches. Once printed, the papers are packed and sealed under strict surveillance before being transported to 
            examination centers.</p>
    
    </ol>
    <h2>Maintaining security and integrity</h2>
    <p>The entire process is shrouded in secrecy to prevent examination malpractice and maintain the credibility of the papers. UNEB takes 
        several measures to ensure integrity:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Anonymous personnel</strong>: The identities of the examiners who set the papers are kept secret to prevent any external influence
                 or attempts at bribery.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Strict access control</strong>: Only authorized and thoroughly vetted personnel are allowed access to the question bank, printing
                 press, and exam materials.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Collaboration with security agencies</strong>: For transportation and storage of the exam papers, UNEB works closely with security 
                agencies and inspectors to ensure the safety of the materials.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Continuous improvement</strong>: The UNEB exam-setting process is continually reviewed and updated to adapt to modern challenges and
                 incorporate technological improvements to enhance security.</li>
        </ul>
