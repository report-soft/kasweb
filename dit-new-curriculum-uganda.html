  <h1>The Role of DIT in the new curriculum in Uganda</h1>
  <div class="feature-card sec2">

<p>Uganda's education system is undergoing a major transformation with the roll-out of the new lower secondary curriculum. 
    A central pillar of this reform is a shift from rote learning to a competency-based model that prioritizes practical, 
    employable skills. The <strong>Directorate of Industrial Training (DIT)</strong> is at the heart of this change, bringing its expertise 
    in Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) to formal classroom education.</p>
<p>The new curriculum Uganda aims to prepare students for the "world of work" from an early age, addressing the persistent 
    challenge of youth unemployment. To this end, eight pre-vocational subjects—including <strong>Agriculture, ICT, and Entrepreneurship</strong>—have
     been integrated into the lower secondary school timetable. This is where the DIT Uganda mandate becomes critical. As the 
     national skills quality assurance body, DIT is responsible for conducting the competency-based assessment and certification 
     for all learners undertaking these vocational subjects.</p>
<p>For the first time, students will not only receive a Uganda Certificate of Education (UCE) but can also be awarded a <strong>Level One
     competency certificate</strong> from DIT in their chosen vocational skill. This provides a direct, recognized pathway to further 
     vocational training or immediate employment for students who excel in practical skills, a significant paradigm shift from 
     the previous, academically focused system.</p>
<p>Implementing this new model is not without its challenges. Schools, especially in rural areas, have faced hurdles in securing
     the necessary resources and training for teachers to effectively deliver the practical components of the curriculum. Furthermore, 
     accurately assessing and reporting on a student's competency level requires a new system of evaluation. The standard report card, 
     which once relied on simple percentage scores, is now obsolete.</p>
<p>To address these assessment challenges, innovative solutions like the <strong>Shuleni Report Card System</strong> have emerged. Designed 
    specifically for the new curriculum, this system automates the complex grading process, allowing schools to generate compliant
     and detailed reports that capture not just subject grades but also generic skills, attitude, and continuous assessment scores. 
     By leveraging such technological tools, schools can produce the new, holistic report cards accurately and efficiently, ensuring
      that the valuable vocational skills are properly documented and communicated to parents and future employers.</p>
